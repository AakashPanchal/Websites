We believe that one is incomplete without the other and pre-school as an institution is the right place to begin such an effort. A healthy body supports successful learning as much as successful learning supports good health.<br><br>

									Cambridge Colours leadership is working towards a unique but targeted effort of creating a common forum for Educationists, Healthcare Professionals and Special Educators to bring the best internationalpractices to our students.<br>

									Our ultimate mission is to provide a healthy learning environment to all the children under its umbrella through empowerment of our teachers with research-based teaching skills and enriching parents with awareness. <br>
