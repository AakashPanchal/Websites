      <h3>ABOUT US</h3>
      <p><font size="3">Cambridge Colours is a unique preschool programme with features that work on holistic development 
	  of every child. Apart from skill development, love, care and security are our strongest aspects.</font></p>
	  <p><b><font size="4">India’s First STEM Preschool</font></b></p>
	  <p><font size="3">Simply put, STEM means Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics.<br>
						This educational approach integrates classroom lessons and daily routines. It connects academic skills to practical application so learning becomes meaningful to children’s everyday lives and encourages children to think about what they’re learning in a more connected, holistic way. We at Cambridge Colours International, 
						give a solid STEM foundation with very simple activities to equip the children with the relevant skills. The STEM chapters are fun, vibrant and easy to do.</font></p>
    <p><b><font size="4">Sharp Focus on Safety and Security</font></b></p>
	<p><font size="3"><b>Cambridge Colours cares for your child like you would</b><br>
						Education and development are important, but we know that nothing matters more than the safety, security and health of your child. That’s why protection and preparedness are critical considerations in everything we do at Cambridge Colours.
						<br><br>From first aid training for emergency situations to sanitation and ensuring a clean and healthy environment for children, we have more than 20 years of experience ensuring that every child is happy and healthy. Although scraped knees are a part of growing up, you can have 
						confidence that your child is cared for in a secure, nurturing environment every day. Some of our Safety and Security features are:<br><br>
						
						&#8594; All areas are covered by CCTV and are constantly monitored.<br>
						&#8594; Guard on duty, round the clock.<br>
						&#8594; Only authorized staff and families may enter the center.<br>
						&#8594; Safe, secure perimeters ensure that children can enjoy outdoor play safely.<br>
						&#8594; We use safety gates, window guards and cap electrical outlets.<br>
						&#8594; Our centers include smoke detectors and fire extinguishers.
						</font></p>
	<p><b><font size="4">Children Who Stand Apart!</font></b></p>
	
	<p><font size="3">Every child is endowed with specialized talents and skills. Research shows that the best time to develop and bring out the four critical skills in a child is 0 to 6 years of age. 
	Our philosophy is to prepare even more well rounded children who are ready to think outside the box and turn their creativity into reality. The Cambridge Colours programme focuses on developing natural curiosity and creativity of the children. Our curriculum ensures that through lots of fun activities, 
	every skill is worked on every day. For holistic development of children, it is critical to work not on subjects but skills like:<br><br>
	
						&#8594; Language skill<br>
						&#8594; Cognitive skill<br>
						&#8594; Social skill<br>
						&#8594; Fine and gross motor skill<br><br>
	
	Our children learn to behave, talk and act smartly. They are able to accomplish age appropriate writing and STEM tasks. They are an excellent fit for any reputed formal school.

      <h3>WHY US</h3>
      <p><b><font size="4">What Sets Us Apart</font></b></p>
	  <p><font size="3"><b>“Good beginnings never end” and we give the perfect beginning to your child.</b>
							As per research, up-to 80% development of a human brain takes place by the age of 8 years. We believe, parents should never compromise on the preschool for their children and choose the best possible option. All round development of children is not co-incidental, it needs to be structurally worked upon. When a child’s language skills, cognitive skills, social skills and motor skills are worked on simultaneously, the outcome is an all rounded child. What is fast being left behind by the Indian society is the value system that is embedded into our syllabus. Cambridge Colors’ structured programme is designed to make our children confident, happy and well -groomed ensuring that they stand a class apart.<br><br>
	
							We believe that a good foundation in English helps children master other subjects when they move to primary classes. In order to get the best language outcomes from the toddlers, it is important that Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing are all emphasized equally. Cambridge Colours follows Jolly Phonics, which is known to be one the most structured methods to give children the right start with regards to an impressive diction and reading skills. By providing regular practice to the children in letter formation and blending of words through a sing-song method, Cambridge Colours ensures positive results in English language. Through role-plays and puppet shows, children get the ultimate story telling experience.<br><br>

							Some of our unique differentiators are:<br><br>

&#8594; Secure premises with CCTV surveillance and a guard on duty.<br>
&#8594; Teachers trained in our proprietary “STEMPhonics” teaching methodology developed by Mrs. Anju Mehta.<br>
&#8594; Unique focus on Healthcare and regular physical and mental health monitoring.<br>
&#8594; Management includes renowned educationists and doctors.<br>
&#8594; Skill Room with smart board and socio-motor equipment.<br>
&#8594; Vibrant classrooms with audio visual aids.<br>
&#8594; Indoor and outdoor sand-play activities.<br>
&#8594; Stage and mock mike in every room.<br>
&#8594; Safe and structured daycare facility.<br>
&#8594; Well-qualified and trained teachers.<br>
